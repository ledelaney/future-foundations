With an eye to the future: Why does this matter?</div>

Humans are funny creatures. Our big brains have allowed us to experiment with and understand the world around us, manipulating what we found to create all kinds of wonder: buildings, computers, air conditioning, waiting in line. But of course, not everything we do is wonderful. Or rather, much of the wonder we create is mixed in with other things, too -- our fears, our prejudices, our sadness, our selfishness. Desire for power, desire for control. The work we do as researchers allows us to extend the boundaries of our understanding and shape the world in new ways.

But why extend the boundary of human knowledge? How does that knowledge actually shape the world? Does everyone gain from that, or only some of us? Are there some questions that shouldn't be asked, shouldn't be answered? What is the end goal of research? Improving the world? Understanding the world? In other words, _why do we do what we do_?
