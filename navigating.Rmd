# Navigating this Course {-}

Discovering ourselves -- the values that drive us, the unique set of strengths we possess -- and figuring out how we can enhance and use those gifts in service to the world is profound and meaningful work. Is it also hard work? Sure, it's that too. But I will be here every step of the way to provide support. You are always welcome to [contact me](mailto:ldelan5@uic.edu) for any reason, or stick around after class for drop-in hours. And remember the old saying:

> How do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time.

## The course website {-}

This website will serve as the informal "textbook" for our course. Using the navigation panel on the left (or click the three bars above if on a phone), you will find:

1. A page for each week, outlining the topics, activities, and materials we will cover,  
[[**Watch** and **Read** should be completed before classtime; **Do** are assignments that will be due the following week after class.]]
2. More information on how to submit your assignments under [Submitting Assignments](#submitting-assignments), and 
3. Important course policies and information under [Policies](#policies).
