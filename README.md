# HON 301 Foundations for the Future :flamingo:

Foundations for the Future is a course about two things:

1. establishing practical and emotional skills to aid in our work as young scholars, and
2. establishing a professional identity by examining the personal motivations that drive our work.

This repo contains the source for the Fall 2021 [Foundations for the Future course website](https://ledelaney.org/teaching/2021/future-foundations/). This digital course "textbook" was built using the R package `bookdown` with the `bs4` theme. The book borrows its bones from Hadley Wickham's [R for Data Science](https://github.com/hadley/r4ds).
