Honing our skills: Who gets to do research?</div>

Access to educational opportunity -- like many things in this country -- is not equal nor equitable. The numbers are very clear:[^19] large and persistent disparities exist in educational attainment across racial and ethnic groups. A long history of systematic oppression and segregation, institutionalized discriminatory practices, and income inequality mean that many of our colleges and universities are composed of disproportionately more White[^20] students and an overwhelmingly White faculty. White-dominant culture operates as a social mechanism through which White folks are granted advantages by being the "default" racial identity -- holding the majority of the political, institutional, and economic power.[^21]

And of course, the work of academia -- our research and teaching -- is not done in a vacuum. As we know from our class discussions, who we are and the way we view the world has an enormous influence on our work. But beyond that: who decides what work is important? Who decides what questions are worth asking and answering? Who interprets the data, and through what lens do they interpret it? Whose scholarship is respected and valued? Whose scholarship is taught in classrooms? It is our responsibility as researchers to seriously consider these questions and consider our work within the greater context of society. The act of extending human knowledge -- what research is all about -- will never be as powerful or effective as long as it is dominated by only one group and perspective.

This week, we will spend our time in class critically examining the institution of academia -- as a place of higher learning and a place of research -- and its long history perpetuating structural inequalities. We will discuss pioneering scholars that triumphed in fields of study where they were not welcome and those that were left behind. And we will take this opportunity to consider how our experiences shape us and our worldview, and how that diversity of perspectives enriches our world.

1. Do you feel comfortable with your progress in the class so far? Do you have anything you wish to add to my report?
2. How are you enjoying HON 301 so far? Is there anything I could do that would improve your experience?
3. What have you found the most difficult so far? What have you enjoyed the most?
4. Do you feel like this class is helping you prepare for your Capstone? If not, what could be improved?
5. Anything else you'd like to share!

[^20]: Whether or not to capitalize "White" when describing race is an area of active debate. Currently, I choose to capitalize it per [the National Association of Black Journalists](https://www.nabj.org/page/styleguide). Whiteness is a racial identity that holds enormous power and privilege in our country: we must acknowledge that fact to understand how that power is levereged to uphold racist policies, instutitions, and laws.
