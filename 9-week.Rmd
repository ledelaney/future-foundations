You will receive an email from me with your mid-semester progress report this week. I would like you to reflect on this report and what we've accomplished in class so far. For homework, respond to this email and touch on the following:

1. Do you feel comfortable with your progress in the class so far? Do you have anything you wish to add to my report?
2. How are you enjoying HON 301 so far? Is there anything I could do that would improve your experience?
3. What have you found the most difficult so far? What have you enjoyed the most?
4. Do you feel like this class is helping you prepare for your Capstone? If not, what could be improved?
5. Anything else you'd like to share!
