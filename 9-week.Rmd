Honing our skills: Who gets to do research?</div>

Access to educational opportunity -- like many things in this country -- is not equal nor equitable. [The numbers are very clear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_achievement_gap_in_the_United_States): large and persistent disparities exist in educational attainment across racial and ethnic groups.

But beyond that: who decides what work is important? Who decides what questions are worth asking and answering? Who interprets the data, and through what lens do they interpret it? Whose scholarship is respected and valued?
