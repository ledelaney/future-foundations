Finding our Direction: What interests us?</div>

The first stop of any research endeavor is nailing down an area of interest. Hopefully, most of us have a sense of the general field we wish to investigate. No matter how granular a research question can get, it can always be tied back to a broader field of study. For instance, one of my dissertation chapters asks the question, _What is the phylogenetic distribution and frequency of self-incompatibility in Fabaceae?_ This question exists in a sort of "topical heirarchy" from specific to broad like so:

It's not important that you know what all of these terms mean, just that you can see that research questions are usually very specific but exist within a broader field like "art" or "biology" or "philosophy." (Those fields exist within even broader categories, like the sciences or humanities.) Within a discipline like philosophy, there are then sub-disciplines that are also quite broad, like epistemology, metaphysics, or aesthetics.

Our job this week is to start investigating the various sub-disciplines within our field so that we may find an area of interest for our research. There are lots of questions in the world -- and to find them requires reading!
