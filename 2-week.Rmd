# Week 2: Sep 3

**Topic**  
Finding our Direction: What interests us?</div>

The first stop of any research endeavor is nailing down an area of interest. Hopefully, most of us have a sense of the general field we wish to investigate. No matter how granular a research question can get, it can always be tied back to a broader field of study. For instance, one of my dissertation chapters asks the question, _What is the phylogenetic distribution and frequency of self-incompatibility in Fabaceae?_ This question exists in a sort of "topical hierarchy" from specific to broad like so:

<div id="center">
![Topical hierarchy of a research area.](images/topic-heirarchy.png){width="70%"}
</div>

It's not important that you know what all of these terms mean, just that you can see that research questions are usually very specific but exist within a broader field like "art" or "biology" or "philosophy." (Those fields exist within even broader categories, like the sciences or humanities.) Within a discipline like philosophy, there are then sub-disciplines that are also quite broad, like epistemology, metaphysics, or aesthetics.

Our job this week is to start investigating the various sub-disciplines within our field so that we may find an area of interest for our research. There are lots of questions in the world -- and to find them requires reading!

## Do

_Due no later than Thursday, September 9 at 11:59p_

For your assignment this week, use [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) or the [University Library website](https://library.uic.edu/) to search for a review article in your area of interest.  Your job is to find one review article and read it carefully. If you are having trouble finding one, send me an email or visit me after class for drop-in hours and I can help. While you read the article, take notes. There are three main ways to do this:

+ Take notes on a separate piece of paper or document on your computer (generally, I recommend computer notes because they are searchable and more difficult to lose, but I myself prefer handwritten notes so it's up to you),
+ Print the review article and write notes and highlight portions as you read, or
+ Use a tablet device or your computer to highlight and take digital notes as you read.

For homework, you will send the following:

1. Your notes from the review article. This will either be a scanned copy of written notes on a separate piece of paper or on the document itself, **or** a digital file with notes. 
2. A PDF copy of the review article.
